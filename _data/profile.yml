  <p>
    I am a computer vision researcher in the <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/" >LPR</a> team of NVIDIA Research. I received my Ph.D. from University of California, Merced supervised by <a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/">Ming-Hsuan Yang</a>. Before coming to UC Merced, I obtained my M.S. degree and B.S. degree from Tsinghua University (THU) and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) on 2016 and 2013 respectively. I am interested in all 3D vision related topics.
